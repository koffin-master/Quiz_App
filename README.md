✨ How It Works

• Timer: You’ll have 30 seconds for each question—so think fast! ⏳

🏆 Challenges Faced 1. CORS Issues: Initially, I ran into CORS issues when trying to fetch quiz data from the API 😅. Thankfully, I solved it by using a CORS proxy to bypass restrictions. 🚧 2. Timer Management: Ensuring the timer stops at 0 and automatically proceeds to the next question required some clever use of React’s hooks. ⏱️ 3. Scoring Logic: Implementing a way to accurately calculate the score based on multiple-choice answers was fun! 🎯
